            <p>
            I am Zachary Elliott. I am a full stack developer who is proficient in SQL, MongoDB, Node.js, JQuery, and CSS. <br/><br/>
            I graduated from Cherry Creek High School in 2020.
            When I was there, I played Junior Varsity tennis for three of the years and Varsity Tennis for my senior year. 
            I also took a couple computer science courses.
            I worked at King Soopers (Kroger) as a Courtesy Clerk from December of 2019 until July of 2021. 
            I quit a little before I started school in order to focus on doing well in school.<br/><br/>

            I have been going to school at The University of Denver Bootcamps. I have studied software development in and out of class. 
            I will be graduating soon and I hope to land a job in the field of software development.
