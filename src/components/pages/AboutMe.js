            I am Zachary Elliott. I am a full stack developer who is proficient in SQL, MongoDB, Node.js, JQuery, and CSS. <br/><br/>

            I graduated from Cherry Creek High School in 2020.
            When I was there, I played Junior Varsity tennis for three of the years and Varsity Tennis for my senior year. 
            I also took a couple computer science courses.<br/><br/>
            
            I worked at King Soopers (Kroger) as a Courtesy Clerk from December of 2019 until July of 2021. 
            I quit a little before I started school in order to focus on doing well in school.<br/><br/>

            I went to the University of Denver and I studied full stack development. 
            From my studies I gained skills in MERN stack development (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), 
            MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, GraphQL, Handlebars, Agile Methodologies, etc. 
            I did extra studying outside of class to learn more about the technical process of Search Engine Optimization (SEO),
            Data Structures and Algorithms, Python (Flask and Django), and Java (Spring). <br /> <br />

            I recently accepted a postion as an Associate Software Developer at Charles Schwab.
            I am also willing to do work on the side. Please see my page on services or contact me to learn more.
