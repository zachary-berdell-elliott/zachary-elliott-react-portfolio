                Did you have a simple website that you need built?
                Maybe you just have something that needs to be fixed or need some integrations.
                I can offer my full stack development services for part time if either of these interest you.<br /> <br />

                Prices will be given on an as request basis. Use the contact form to submit your request.
                Your request will then be reviewed and you will receive information on what the service would cost and if I would be able to do it. <br /><br />

                <strong>Note: Due to my current job, I can't do work for any financial institutions. Please seek out another developer if this applies to you.</strong>
